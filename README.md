## Project overview
* browser -> emulator -> application
* application has no knowledge of the browser

## Architecture Overview
* Data
    * IApp : an application should implement this interface, it's a contract between emulator and the application about the application should look like
    * IElement : an interface of how an element on the page should looks like 
    * IFunction : define the looks of a callback function
    * IListItem : a way on how the ListItem should be rendered
    * IPage : to describe how to structure the page
* Services
    * IActionService : the services exposes to the application from the emulator
    * IStateService : a wrapper class around the IApp object
    * ISystemService : utilities for all the runtime emulator functions
    * ITemplatingService : manipulation about the DOM

## Directory Structure:
* dist: final production code distribution generated by Webpack.
* temp: For debug only, NOT FOR PRODUCTION. Modules loaded by SystemJS. All the js compile via coding-time, we debug from this folder. 
* src: source codes
* test: test cases

## Some files:
* tsconfig.json: configuration file for typescript
* package.json: configuration file for npm
* webpack.config.js: configuration file for webpack
* design.txt: architecture design
