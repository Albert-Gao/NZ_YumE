    <h2>1. About the app</h2>
    <h3>1.1 Intro</h3>
    <p>This App enables you to search for restaurants in Dunedin. The back-end service is supported by Yelp.com. Every time you search, the app will send the keyword to the REST API from Yelp.com, retrieve the result from it, tailor the information, and finally render it to the browser. You can click the "Map" button to see the location of the restaurant, or you can click the "Back" button to return to the search page to start a new search. The map page has a marker labelled F which shows where the restaurant that was searched for is, and also has a marker labelled U (i.e. You) at the Octagon for reference. On this page, you can either go back to the restaurant information page, or back to the search page to conduct another search. The map is generated using Google's static map api.</p>

    <h2>2. About the architecture</h2>
    <h3>2.1 Brief</h3>
    <p>The application sits on top of an emulator, and it implements an interface called IApp The implementation will contain the app's information and its pages, something like a UI description and callback function. Basically the application describes itself via the IApp interface. During runtime, the emulator will create an instance of this interface using the provided application implementation, handle its callback, and translate/render its UI to the browser.</p>
    <p><strong>The application and emulator is decoupled in this way,</strong> so anytime you want create a new application, you just need to implement the IApp interface and the emulator will do the rest of the work for you. You're free to modify anything in your application as long as you implement the IApp interface. No corresponding modification is needed on the emulator side and vice versa.</p>
    <p>Furthermore,<strong> the pages of the application and the application itself are decoupled too</strong>, in a similar manner to the above via the IPage interface.</p>

    <h3>2.2 Some more details</h3>
    <h4>2.2.1 Application:</h4>
    <p>When you look at the IApp interface, besides normal properties, the key thing it has is the function CentralCallbackFunc(), which acts like a dispatcher, dispatching events every time the user triggers them in the browser. The browser will first pass the event back to a callback function inside the emulator, which will wrap some information according to the implementation of IApp interface, and then pass it to the app's CentralCallbackFunc(). This function will then dispatch the event to the actual handler function in the appropriate page of the app (which will be an implementation of IPage).</p>

    <h4>2.2.2 Emulator</h4>
    <p>Like the application side, <strong>the emulator part is decoupled internally.</strong> It contains the following parts:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Emulator class:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>This class is the only class in this project which doesn't implement any interfaces since its job is to just be scaffolding. It will assemble all the service classes as well as the application during runtime via <strong>dependency injection</strong> and will boot the emulator.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>IActionService</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>This is a service which the emulator uses to expose some actions to the application. Anytime the application wants to trigger something like showNotification(), goPage() or FetchAPI(), it will just call this API, and the emulator will then handle them for it.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>IStateService</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>This is a wrapper class which wraps around the implementation class of the IApp interface. When any services try to access the application object, they don't access it directly. Instead, they call this IStateService, which will handle the requests. Anytime we have some modification to the IApp interface, we only have to change the IStateService. We don't need to modify every class which tries to access the application object.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>ISystemService</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>This service provides all the functionality that the emulator wants. When the emulator wants to invoke some function, it can simply call the methods from this service. This means the actual emulator class only need to assemble the architecture, with no concern for the actual implementation logic.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>ITemplatingService</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>This service contains all the operations related to the DOM. It has a wrapper method called createjQueryItem() around jQuery to give a clean way to create a DOM element via a single function call. It can render the application into HTML elements, and has methods to delete elements as well.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>2.2.3 System processing</h4>
    <p>When the project starts, it will first create a new instance of the emulator class, and inside the constructor to this class, it will assemble all the services as well as the application via dependency injection. It will then call the startEmulator() method. The following things will then occur:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Shows the splash screen of the emulator to indicate the system has started.</li>
        <li>Hides the splash screen.</li>
        <li>Translates all the pages to jQuery objects and stores them back to the application object.</li>
        <li>Finds the start page and renders it to the emulator.</li>
        <li>The first screen of the application will then be displayed.</li>
        <li>Whenever the user triggers an event like click:
            <ul>
                <li>The browser will pass the information to the emulator's call back function.</li>
                <li>The emulator will operate on this information and pass it back to the central dispatcher in the application.</li>
                <li>The application will do some business logic here and then pass it back to the handler in the appropriate page.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>3. About the folder structure:</h2> 
    The naming scheme follows industry convention.
    <ul>
        <li><strong>dist:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>The distribution folder contains the builds for the final release. We build using webpack. You will notice that webpack has bundled all our multiple source code files into one single index.bundle.js file along with its source map for debugging. This is for faster loading speed due to the decreased file requests.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>temp</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>We used the "compileOnSave" feature of typescript's compiler. Every time we save, the compiler will compile the .ts file and store the result javaScript file into this folder, which was convenient for debugging.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>src</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>This folder contains all our source code. It has the following sub-folders.</li>
                <li><strong>application: </strong>Source code for the applications component.</li>
                <li><strong>emulator:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>models:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>dataModels: </strong>Interfaces for application sides like IApp, IPage, etc.</li>
                                <li><strong>serviceModels: </strong>Interfaces for service classes.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>services: </strong>Actual implementations of the service classes.</li>
                        <li><strong>UI</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>css : </strong>Style sheet for the emulator.</li>
                                <li><strong>js: </strong>Third party libraries.</li>
                                <li><strong>types: </strong>Type definition files for typescript.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>spec: </strong>The test cases for this projects. Used by jasmine.</li>
        <li><strong>docs: </strong>The documentation for this project. Generated by typedoc.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>4. Development</h2>
    <p>This project takes advantage of the modern front end toolchain a lot. We have configured node packages to provide us with an auto-build system:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Auto build to dist folder:</strong> Using the command "webpack --progress --watch"</li>
        <li><strong>Auto build to temp folder:</strong> Will transpile when saving a ts file while, allowing for quick debugging. You can also manually compile with the command "tsc".</li>
        <li><strong>Source maps:</strong> With these you can debug typescript directly in the browser, as it enables you to view the underlying typeScript files rather than the generated javaScript ones.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This system was great, as once set up, pretty much everything was done automatically. The system would watch for changes, and update everything when found, allowing for very quick code, test, debug cycles.</p> 
        
    <h2>5. Testing</h2>
    <p>The application has been tested, and shown to be working in Chrome, Chromium, Firefox and Qutebrowser, on OSX, Ubuntu, and Windows, as well as in Edge on Windows. All test cases pass in all of those browsers. There was some slight difficulty with Chrome at one point due to their cross origin domain policy preventing other files being loaded. This affected loading fixtures (what jasmine-jquery calls chunks of html that tests can be run against) from external files. There is a command line flag that can be set when opening chrome to get around this, but for our tests, we didn't really need to have pages elaborate enough to warrant putting them in separate files, so could just specify the full html (often just a single div) of the fixture within the test that needed them.</p>
    <p>While we initially had jasmine doing tests via the command line, we moved to the browser interface once we started needing to test some of the jQuery features, as we couldn't get this to work properly using the CLI.</p>

    <h2>6. About the team communication</h2>
    <p>We cooperated as a team in a well-organised way. Everyone contributed to the final project in their own way, be it coding, testing, documenting, reporting or proof-reading. We held meetings for each milestone. We communicated with each other often regarding the architecture design to make sure everyone stayed on the same boat.</p>

    <h2>7. Other thoughts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Architecture design matters:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>It took us a long time to discuss the whole architecture design. We tried to decouple things in a meaningful and sensible manner. This really made the final coding a great experiences, since whenever we needed to refactor, it wasn't a huge pain.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Testing matters:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>The testing part is really important since it can find many bugs which the compiler can't tell you about. We found bugs in the testing phase that were confusing us a lot during initial development. The initial command line tests gave us confidence that the bits we had done were working. We heavily used <strong>dependency injection</strong> throughout the design which made testing each part a bit easier since due to loose coupling. It enabled us to program at a very fast pace as we were programming to an interface, not an implementation.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Types matter:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>TypeScript has played a crucial role during the development phase. We are happy with our choice to use it over vanilla javaScript. The typing system along with the interface declarations allowed for great productivity. It has complete toolchain support so most of the time we just needed to handle the actual business logic. Compared to the javaScript or ES6, we surely lost some flexibility with typeScript, but it was easily worth it to help catch simple errors quickly.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
